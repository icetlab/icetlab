<b> Hazem (Peter) Samoaa </b>

I am a PhD student at Chalmers University of Technology, working on the intersection of data science and software engineering. My primary area of research is on the usage of active learning for regression models, particularly applied to the use case of predicting the execution time of software.

I conduct my PhD studies under the supervision of <a href="http://philippleitner.net">Philipp Leitner</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~haghir/">Morteza Haghir Chehreghani</a>.
